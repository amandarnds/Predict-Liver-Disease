<h2> 1.  Summary </h2>
<p>This experiment aims to create a model to predict if a patient will have liver disease </p> 

<h2> 2.  Description </h2>
<p>This experiment aim to show the process of machine learning. It will be used a dataset to build and train the model.</p>

<h2>3.  Data </h2>
<p>Dataset:
    <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ILPD+(Indian+Liver+Patient+Dataset)">Indian Liver Patient Dataset </a>
</p>
<p> This data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records.</p>
<p> The data set was collected from north east of Andhra Pradesh, India. Selector is a class label used to divide into groups(liver patient or not). </p>
<p> This data set contains 10 variables that are age, gender, total Bilirubin, direct Bilirubin, total proteins, albumin, A/G ratio, SGPT, SGOT and Alkphos. <p> 

<h2>4.Objective </h2>

<p> The objective will be to predict the liver disease 
 The predictive model must be very accurate. </p>
